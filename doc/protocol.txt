This protocol is very simple and passes raw data. If you want to connect clients or sources over network, you should use
properly secured tunneling software, like ssh. Also, there is no error recovery - if received data is wrong,
the connection is closed.


What daemon does:

switch(read 1 byte)
case 0x00: // source sends entropy
    read 3 bytes:
        - pool number // must be in range [0,31]
        - source number
        - data_size // must be in range [1,31]
    read data_size bytes
case 0x01: // send me random data
    read 4 bytes: requested_length
    if (data generated successfully):
        write 1 byte: 0x00
        write requested_length bytes
    else if (request too big): // implemented in libfortuna
        write 1 byte: 0x01
    else if (generator is not seeded):
        write 1 byte: 0x02
