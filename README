General Information
===================

This is implementation of Fortuna PRNG (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna_%28PRNG%29)
in C++11 using Boost and Crypto++ libraries, originally written by Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>.

Components:
  - libfortuna          - Implementation of Fortuna algorithm.
  - fortunad            - Daemon which contains Accumulator.
  - libfortuna_daemon   - Libraries implementing communication layer with daemon for entropy sources and clients.
  - fortuna_client      - Client which reads random data from daemon.

Licensing:
  - Libraries (libfortuna, libfortuna_daemon) are released under LGPLv3 or later.
  - Programs (everything else) are released under GPLv3 or later.
  - Components contains parts of stdex library (https://github.com/etam/stdex), which is released under the WTFPLv2.

Tested with:
  - g++         4.7.2
  - autoconf    2.69
  - automake    1.12.1
  - libtool     2.4.2
  - Boost       1.53.0
  - Crypto++    5.6.2


Notes about libfortuna
======================
  - SHA3 (Keccak) is used instead of double SHA2.
  - Random data is generated in blocks of bytes. User must allocate enough memory to store whole blocks.
    In Accumulator there are output_block_length variable and bytes_to_blocks method, which helps with this task.
  - The library is thread safe.
